Hello! I’m Zhijian Tan, a passionate biomedical engineering student with a keen interest in photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT)and ultrasound computed tomography (USCT). I received my B.S. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology and my M.S. degree in Electronic Information Engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, where I delved into the fascinating world of medical imaging.

I’ve developed a GPU-accelerated filtered back-projection (FBP) image reconstruction algorithm for PACT and explored full waveform inversion (FWI) techniques in USCT. These experiences not only sharpened my technical skills but also ignited my enthusiasm for applying innovative solutions to real-world medical challenges.

In my spare time, I love to stay curious—whether it's reading about the latest advancements in technology, exploring the outdoors, playing badminton, or enjoying a good meal. I believe that a well-rounded life fuels creativity, and I’m always eager to learn something new.

I look forward to connecting with others who share my passion for advancing healthcare through technology!
